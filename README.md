<h1 align="center">Laravel Pharmacy Management System</h1>

### Introduction

<p align="justify">This medical prescription application is designed to streamline the prescription process for users and pharmacies. Its main features include user registration, user login, and the ability to upload prescriptions. Upon uploading, a pharmacy admin can access and review the prescriptions. The application allows the pharmacy admin to prepare quotations for the uploaded prescriptions and send them to the respective users. These quotations will be displayed in the user's account.</p>

<p align="justify">To enhance the user experience, the application is built using a stack that includes Laravel, HTML 5, CSS, Bootstrap, Ajax, and MySQL for robust and efficient functionality.</p>

<p align="justify">The prescription process is made seamless for users as they can easily accept or reject the quotation provided by the pharmacy. Once the user makes a decision, the system will automatically notify the pharmacy about the user's acceptance or rejection status.</p>

<p align="justify">The primary aim of this application is to provide a convenient and reliable platform for managing medical prescriptions, benefiting both users and pharmacies. For a visual demonstration of the application, you can watch the demo project at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiyav_8PnT4 </p>
